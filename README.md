# Green Neighbourhood Community Center

## Welcome!

This repository houses the full-stack web application for the Green Neighbourhood Community Center (GNCC), a project fostering sustainability and community engagement in Singapore.

## Project Overview

The GNCC web app empowers residents to:

Connect: Discover and participate in local green initiatives, events, and discussions.
Learn: Access educational resources on sustainable living practices and environmental awareness.
Collaborate: Share ideas, volunteer opportunities, and expertise to build a greener neighbourhood.
Motivate: Find inspiration, celebrate achievements, and support others on their sustainability journeys.

## Technical Stack

This project leverages a robust and scalable technology stack to deliver a dynamic and user-friendly experience:

Frontend: React (https://react.dev/) for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Backend: Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) and Express (https://expressjs.com/) for server-side rendering and API development.

Database: MongoDB (https://www.mysql.com/) for flexible and efficient data storage.

Deployment: Not deployed/hosted. Might consider platforms like Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/), AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/), or Google Cloud Platform (https://cloud.google.com/) to host the application.

### Considerations

Accessibility: Considering to adhere to Singapore's Infocomm Accessibility Standards (https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/wcag-2-1.html) to ensure the application is usable for people with disabilities.
Multilingual Support: Considering to incorporate support for commonly spoken languages in Singapore (e.g., English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil).
Data Privacy: Be mindful of Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) (https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/overview-of-pdpa/the-legislation/personal-data-protection-act) when handling user data.
